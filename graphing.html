<h1>Graphing functions with Julia</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The <code>Julia</code> language is a new language and as such, certain design decisions are still being made. One key decision is the interface for creating graphics. At this point there are many different ones (<code>Winston</code>, <code>Gadfly</code>, <code>Gaston</code>, <code>PyPlot</code>, plotly, plotlyjs, <code>GR</code>...), and perhaps more will be generated before a dominant one is arrived at. As such, we don't try to teach the details of any one of them.</p><p>Rather, we use the <code>Plots</code> package which provides a unified interface to many backend plotting pacakges. This package is loaded when the <code>MTH229</code> package is.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<div class="markdown"><p>Packages are described a bit more <a href="http://mth229.github.io/index.html/#_packages_">here</a>.</p>
</div> 
</div>
<p>For the impatient, this is all that is needed to know to get up and running.</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">using MTH229  # to load Plots</pre>
<p>Then, graphing a function is as easy as specifying the function and the domain to graph over, e.g.:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = exp(-x^2/2)
plot(f, -3, 3) 			# plot f over [-3,3]</pre>

<h3>Inf, NaN values</h3><p><code>Plots</code> plots functions by creating a large number of paired points $(x, f(x))$; it then plots these points; and, finally, connects the points with line segments. In the numerous function evaluations, it is of course quite possible that some of the points will return <code>Inf</code> or <code>NaN</code>. (Where <code>Inf</code> is a floating point value for infinity and results from evaluations like <code>1/0</code> and <code>NaN</code> stands for "not a number", and results from indeterminate evaluations such as <code>0/0</code>.)</p><p>The values which are <code>Inf</code> can not reasonably be plotted. Values  which are <code>NaN</code> can not reasonably plotted. What to do? Such points are simply not plotted, and no line segments are drawn causing the plot to be discontinuous. This convention can be utilized to good effect.</p><p>For example, to create bounded graphs, we can trim out any large values and replace them with <code>NaN</code>. A function that can be used to modify an arbitrary function (like $f(x) = 1/x$) and return a function that can be plotted can be defined as follows:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">trim(f; val=10) = x -> abs(f(x)) > val ? NaN : f(x)</pre>
<pre class="output">
trim (generic function with 1 method)</pre>

<p>This trimming also works when <code>Inf</code> and <code>-Inf</code> values are encountered, as both can be ordered by <code>&gt;</code>.</p><h3>Plotting with anonymous functions</h3><p>Consider a function with a parameter, <code>theta</code>, defined by:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">function g(x; theta=pi/4)
	 a = 200*cos(theta)
	 tan(theta)*x + (32/a)*x - 32*log(a/(a-x))
end</pre>
<pre class="output">
g (generic function with 1 method)</pre>

<p>Plotting <code>g</code> will use the default value of $\pi/4$. To plot with a different value, say $\pi/6$ we can create a new function:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = g(x, theta=pi/3)

<h2>Asymptotes</h2><p>A rational function is nothing more than a ratio of polynomial functions, say $f(x) = p(x)/q(x)$. One interesting thing about such function is there can be asymptotes. These can be vertical (which can happen when $q(x)=0$), horizontal (as $x$ gets large or small), or even slant.</p><p>The vertical asymptotes require care when plotting, as the naive style of plotting where a collection of points is connected by straight lines can render poor graphs when the scale of $y$ values get too large. The really large values plotted near the asymptote can wipe out the possibility of seeing other features of interest in a graph.</p><p>Some features of interest for a graph that are identifiable by calculus concepts are:</p><ul>
<li><p>zeroes</p>
</li>
<li><p>vertical asymptotes</p>
</li>
<li><p>horizontal asymptotes (or even slant ones)</p>
</li>
<li><p>relative maximum and minimum</p>
</li>
<li><p>increasing and decreasing parts</p>
</li>
<li><p>changes in inflection</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For example, if you want to find zeroes of a function, you really want to look at areas of the graph where the $y$ values are close to $0$. However, if you have a vertical asymptote on the same graph, the $y$ values might also be asked to show very large or small values. With only a finite number of pixels available, it is impossible to easily do both.</p><p>What to do? If you were on a smartphone, you might be tempted to pan around to avoid the asymptotes, then pinch and zoom narrow the graph to the feature of interest.  With <code>julia</code> you basically do the same thing, though panning and zooming is done by changing the domain of the $x$ values used in plotting.</p><p>Let's look at the function $f(x) = 1/x$, which has an obvious vertical asymptote at $0$.</p><p>One can try a simple plot:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">plot(x -> 1/x, -3, 3) </pre>

<p>The issue at $0$ is avoided, as the points chosen by <code>Plots</code> do not include $0$. The asymptote appears as a strongly slanted line, as individual points are simply connected in a dot-to-dot manner.</p><p>Doing better without much work is done by simply restricting the part that is plotted. (Alternatively, you can use <code>NaN</code> values or multiple functions on one.) For this example, we can easily draw the positive part:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">plot(x -> 1/x, 0, 3)</pre>

<p>It appears that the relative maximum occurs between $-1$ and $0$.</p><p>Here we see what happens to the asymptote. The scale of the $y$ values is huge.  We added a small amount to the left endpoint in case the function is not defined there, but this function takes the reciprocal of a small amount and makes it huge.  Clearly we need to really avoid the issue. It isn't hard – just add a little bit more to $0$.</p><p>One solution to avoiding this issue is to use the <code>trim</code> function that was previously defined. This just caps off really large values so that the vertical asymptotes don't affect the scale of the graph. We can see the asymptotes pretty clearly with:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">trim(f; val=10) = x -> abs(f(x)) > val ? NaN : f(x)

<h2>Arrays</h2><p>When we learn how to make a graph using paper and pencil, the "T" method is employed, so called as we draw a "T" and fill in values to plot for $x$ and $y$. </p><p>For example, a chalkboard after the instructor shows how to plot $f(x) = x^2$ might have this drawn on it:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x |  y
------
1 |  1
2 |  4
3 |  9
4 | 16</pre>
<p>As these are the steps done to create the ordered pairs for a plot, we would like to be able to mimic the following procedures used above in <code>julia</code>:</p><ul>
<li><p>choose a collection of $x$ values</p>
</li>
<li><p>create the corresponding $y$ values</p>
</li>
<li><p>plot the pairs $(x,y)$ and connect with lines</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We have seen how variables can be used to refer to a single value, but we want to refer to more than one value now. A container for holding such is an <code>Array</code>. Arrays are implemented in most all computer languages, though the term can mean different things.  We are looking for vectors, or one-dimensional arrays.  In general, an array is a multidimensional grid of values – all of the same type (integer, floating point, <em>functions</em>, ..., or ANY).</p><p>For our purposes, we want vectors (one dimensional, $n$ by 1 arrays in <code>julia</code>). These can be easily constructed in different ways.</p><h3>Creating 1-dimensional arrays with <code>&#91;&#93;</code></h3><p>In many different contexts, <code>julia</code> uses <code>&#91;&#93;</code> to create collections from individual components.</p><p>For example, to directly create a 1-dimensional array with the <code>&#91;&#93;</code> syntax one simply types in the values separated by commas:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</pre>
<pre class="output">
5-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5</pre>

<p>Or</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]</pre>
<pre class="output">
6-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 1
 2
 3
 5
 8</pre>

<p>These create "vectors."  Row vectors (which are arrays, but not of type <code>Vector</code>) are created when no commas are specified:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">[13 21 34 55]</pre>
<pre class="output">
1×4 Array{Int64,2}:
 13  21  34  55</pre>

<p>The notation is that <code>&#91;a, b, c&#93;</code> combines <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> vertically and <code>&#91;a b c&#93;</code> combines them horizontally. The former is good to make column vectors for single values (scalars). </p><p>Row and column vectors are different! We will primarily use column vectors going forward.</p><p><strong>Containers are for like values...</strong></p><p>In general, <code>julia</code> uses <code>&#91;</code> and `]' to create containers for like values. These containers can be more complicated than a single row or column. One subtle thing is that each object must be of the same value, though sometimes this happens by a silent conversion. So, mixing integer and floating point numbers will produce a container of just floating point values:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">[1, 2.0]</pre>
<pre class="output">
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 1.0
 2.0</pre>

<h3>Creating arithmetic sequences</h3><p>A basic set of numbers used in programming are the values <code>1</code>,<code>2</code>, ..., <code>n</code>. These are the simplest example of an <em>arithmetic progression</em> or sequence, which in general can start in a different place and have steps of a size different from $1$:</p>$$~
a, a + h, a+2h, a+3h, ..., a + nh
~$$
<p>It should be possible to specify arithmetic sequences either by</p><ul>
<li><p>the start and end points and the number of points employed</p>
</li>
<li><p>the start and end points and step size.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In <code>julia</code> the <code>linspace</code> function will do the former and the range operator the latter.</p><p>Here are 5 evenly spaced numbers from $0$ to $\pi/2$ given by <code>linspace</code> (<em>linearly spaced</em> numbers):</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">linspace(0, pi/2, 5)</pre>
<pre class="output">
0.0:0.39269908169872414:1.5707963267948966</pre>

<p>The values are not displayed, but will be if <code>collect</code>ed:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">collect(linspace(0, pi/2, 5))</pre>
<pre class="output">
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.0     
 0.392699
 0.785398
 1.1781  
 1.5708  </pre>

<p>The <code>5</code> above is optional – the default is 50 points:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">linspace(0, pi/2)</pre>
<pre class="output">
0.0:0.0320570678937734:1.5707963267948966</pre>

<h3>The range operator</h3><p>The "range" operator, <code>:</code>, is used to specify a step size, like $h$ in the definition above. To get values which step by 1 we simply specify the start and end values:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">1:4</pre>
<pre class="output">
1:4</pre>

<p>That isn't so impressive. The description <code>julia</code> uses to show this value is exactly how we defined it, but this range is specifying the values 1, 2, 3, 4. To see that, we <code>collect</code> the values to make an array:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">collect(1:4)</pre>
<pre class="output">
4-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4</pre>

<p>The range operator returns a <code>Range</code> object which is much more compact to store than the array. (The range object is an <em>iterator</em>, something to be stepped through one at a time. Iterating over the elements specified by a range does not require all the elements at once, so they are not generated.)</p><p>The range operator can also work with a step size:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">a=0; b=10; h=3
a:h:b
[a:h:b]</pre>
<pre class="output">
1-element Array{StepRange{Int64,Int64},1}:
 0:3:9</pre>

<p>Notice, the value for <code>b</code> is treated as as suggestion, the range will stop without exceeding <code>b</code>.</p><p>The $x$ values for a plot are typically a sequence of increasing values from $a$ to $b$. We would generally like to be able to specify the number of values to plot. This makes <code>linspace</code> the go-to choice to use. </p><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<div class="markdown"><p>Watch the order of the arguments between <code>linspace</code> and the range operator: With <code>linspace</code> the third argument is optional and is used to indicate how many points, whereas with the range operator, the middle (second) argument is optional, and is used to specify the step size, which is related to how many total values are generated.</p>

<h2>Indexing</h2><p>A column vector has a natural sense of first, second, ..., the $n$-th element. This allows <code>julia</code> to refer to the values by index ($1$-based, unlike some other computer languages). So, if <code>x</code> is an array, <code>x&#91;1&#93;</code> is the first value in that array. One can extract and <em>assign</em> values using indices. A simple example is:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
x[1]
x[3]</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
5</div>

<p>There are some special values. The <code>end</code> value refers to the last ($n$ th):</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x[end]</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
17</div>

<p>The $n$ – or number of elements – can be returned by <code>length</code>:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">length(x)</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
7</div>

<p>A range object can be used for indices:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x[1:3]</pre>
<pre class="output">
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
 2
 3
 5</pre>

<p>The value <code>end</code> can be used in a range when indexing:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x[2:end]</pre>
<pre class="output">
6-element Array{Int64,1}:
  3
  5
  7
 11
 13
 17</pre>

<p>(But not without indexing, as you can see by typing <code>2:end</code> by itself.)</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Left side of an <code>&#61;</code> sign</strong>: <code>Julia</code> allows only three different types of expressions on the left side of an equals sign:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a variable name, as in <code>x &#61; 42</code>,</p>
</li>
<li><p>a function definition, as in <code>f&#40;x&#41; &#61; x^2 - 2</code>, or</p>
</li>
<li><p>a assignment setting an index, as in <code>x&#91;1&#93; &#61; 2</code>.</p>

<p>(The <code>y</code> container is of type <code>Any</code> which allows it to hold any type of object, the <code>x</code> container only holds values of a certain type.)</p><h2>Mapping <small>a function to multiple values</small></h2><p>To specify the $y$ values we wish to "map" the function <code>f</code> to each $x$ value.  In <code>julia</code> there are many different ways to do this, we list four for completeness, but will restrict our attention to just the first three styles.</p><h3>The map function</h3><p>The <code>map</code> function. In many areas of mathematics, one refers to a function as a "map" from the domain to the range. The implication is that the function takes all the $x$ values to the corresponding $y$ values at once (conceptually) and not one at a time. The <code>map</code> function will apply the function <code>f</code> to each value in the array <code>x</code>, basically taking <code>&#91;x1, x2, ..., xn&#93;</code> and returning <code>&#91;f&#40;x1&#41;, f&#40;x2&#41;, ..., f&#40;xn&#41;&#93;</code>.</p><p>For example, let's look at the simple polynomial $f(x) = -16x^2 + 32x$. We define our <code>julia</code> function with:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = -16x^2 + 32x</pre>
<pre class="output">
f (generic function with 1 method)</pre>

<p>If we want to look at this function for $x$ values between $0$ and $2$ we might define the $x$ values with:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = linspace(0, 2, 5)</pre>
<pre class="output">
0.0:0.5:2.0</pre>

<p>Then the <code>map</code> function will create the corresponding $y$ values:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">map(f, x)</pre>
<pre class="output">
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.0
 12.0
 16.0
 12.0
  0.0</pre>

<p>The syntax of <code>map</code> requires a slight pause. Here we do not actually call the function <code>f</code>, as in <code>f&#40;2&#41;</code>. Rather, we pass the name of the function object to the <code>map</code> argument – and <code>map</code> calls the function for each value in the column vector <code>x</code> and returns a corresponding column vector. </p><p>It is also quite common to use anonymous functions with <code>map</code>. For example:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">map(u -> 10 * u^2, x)</pre>
<pre class="output">
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.0
  2.5
 10.0
 22.5
 40.0</pre>

<p>We use <code>u</code> for the dummy variable in the anonymous function, so as not to get it confused with the variable <code>x</code> holding our values, but this is not necessary.</p><h3>Broadcasting</h3><p><code>Julia</code> allows a function to be broadcast over a collection of values with a simple notational trick or inserting a "." <em>before</em> the parenthesis. To see, we have:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">sin.([1,2,3])</pre>
<pre class="output">
3-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.841471
 0.909297
 0.14112 </pre>

<p>In this use, the output is the same as though <code>map&#40;sin, &#91;1,2,3&#93;&#41;</code> were called. In general, this "." notation is a bit different, as there can be multiple arguments passed and the size of the values is matched if possible by replication. For example, this command find the logarithm of 5 for different bases. The value 5 is replicated once for each of the bases:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">log.([2,pi,5,10], 5)</pre>
<pre class="output">
4-element Array{Float64,1}:
 2.32193
 1.40595

<h3>Comprehensions</h3><p>Mathematicians are fond of set notation, as in this way to describe the $y$ values in a graph:</p>$$~
y = \{ f(x): x \text{ in } [0, 2] \},
~$$
<p>This is read: "the values $f(x)$ <em>for</em> each $x$ in the interval $[0,2]$."</p><p>Here we define values <code>xs</code> to represent the continuum of values in the interval $[0,2]$, then use a "comprehension" to create the set notation above. The syntax is similar:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">xs = linspace(0, 2.0, 5)
[f(x) for x in xs]</pre>
<pre class="output">
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.0
 12.0
 16.0
 12.0
  0.0</pre>

<p>In this example we still get a container of type <code>Any</code>. While not critical, we would really like to have this be of type "float", as some math functions care about this distinction. Converting can be done a few ways:</p><ul>
<li><p>by converting the values with <code>float</code> (which coerces the values):</p>
</li>
</ul><pre class="sourceCode julia">map(float, [ f(x) for x in xs ] )</pre>
<pre class="output">
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.0
 12.0
 16.0
 12.0
  0.0</pre>

<ul>
<li><p>By using square brackets and declaring the type:</p>
</li>
</ul><pre class="sourceCode julia">Float64[f(x) for x in xs]</pre>
<pre class="output">
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.0
 12.0
 16.0
 12.0
  0.0</pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Doing this inside a function, where things work a bit differently than at the command line:</p>
</li>
</ul><pre class="sourceCode julia">g(xs) = [f(x) for x in xs]
g(xs)</pre>

<p>The two approaches, maps and comprehensions, are equally useful. Perhaps <code>map</code> is a bit less trouble, but comprehensions mirror a more familiar mathematical syntax and generalize to functions of more than one variable nicely. One difference to keep in mind when deciding which to use, is that mapping requires a function, whereas comprehensions use expressions.</p><h3>For loops</h3><p>Finally, for completeness, we mention another means to generate vectors of numbers that is more familiar to users of other computer languages.</p><p>The <code>for</code> loop is a very common pattern in computer programming. For speed reasons, some languages (e.g., <code>MATLAB</code> and <code>R</code>) try to avoid for loops for a "vectorized" approach (see below), but <code>julia</code> works well with <code>for</code> loops, and they are generally faster than a vectorized approach.</p><p>A <code>for</code> loop simply loops over each value in the iterable data vector <code>x</code> giving it a temporary name as it goes. To use a <code>for</code> loop to create the $y$ values requires several steps. The first creates a container to hold the new values, using the <code>similar</code> function to make a vector of the same size as <code>x</code> below (but fills it with nonsense):</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">y = similar(x);
for i in 1:length(x)
   y[i] = f( x[i] )
end</pre>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop ends with the keyword <code>end</code>. Here we loop over each index of <code>x</code> and assign to the corresponding <code>y</code> value <code>f&#40;x&#91;i&#93;&#41;</code>.</p><p>Conceptually this is the opposite of <code>map</code> where we think of the function acting on the entire column vector <code>x</code>. Instead, we iterate one-by-one over the values of <code>x</code> saving the function values as we go. The use of for loops is called <em>imperative programming</em>, as you describe each step. The use of functions like <code>map</code> is called <em>declarative programming</em> as you simply declare what you want and the computer language does the rest.</p><p>In some languages for loops are avoided if possible, as they can be slower. As well, they can require extra bookkeeping, such as needing to allocate a container for the answers. That being said, in <code>julia</code> they are widely used for speed and storage reasons. As well, they are used when we need to refer to more than one index. An example of that is the following way to create a Fibonacci pattern from the formula $x_i = x_{i-1} + x_{i-2}$:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">x = zeros(Int, 10); 		## pre-allocate an integer array
x[1:2] = [1,1]
for i in 3:length(x)
   x[i] =  x[i-1] + x[i-2]
end</pre>
<p>Related to a <code>for</code> loop is the <code>while</code> loop. This will repeat as long as some condition is true. The following pattern reproduces a <code>for</code> loop:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">i, n = 1, length(x)
while (i <= n)
  print( x[i], " " )			## do something ...
  i = i + 1
end</pre>
<p>We will use <code>while</code> loops when we iterate some process and are waiting until some computed value gets close to $0$.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>Putting this altogether, to create the "T"-table used to graph $y=x^2$, we could do any of these:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = x^2
xs = 1:4
ys = map(f, xs)
[xs ys]                                  # integer type</pre>
<pre class="output">
4×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 1   1
 2   4
 3   9
 4  16</pre>

<p>or</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = x^2
xs = 1:4
ys = f.(xs)
[xs ys]                                  # integer type</pre>
<pre class="output">
4×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 1   1
 2   4
 3   9
 4  16</pre>

<p>or</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
ys = [x^2 for x in xs]
[xs ys]                                   # Any type, as y is -- not the same</pre>
<pre class="output">
4×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 1   1
 2   4
 3   9
 4  16</pre>

<p>or</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">xs = 1:4
ys = similar(xs)
for i in 1:length(xs)			   
    ys[i] = xs[i]^2			  # integer, as x[i] is
end
[xs ys]</pre>
<pre class="output">
4×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 1   1
 2   4
 3   9
 4  16</pre>

</div>
</div>
<p>Often we wish to plot a function derived from another function. For example, this is used to add a secant line to a graph. The following function (which is in the <code>MTH229</code> package) will create a function which represents the secant line of $f(x)$ between two points, $a$ and $b$:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">function secant(f, a, b)
	 m =  (f(b) - f(a)) / (b-a)	# slope of secant line
	 x -> f(a) + m * (x - a)	
end</pre>
<p>Pause for a moment to see what this function does. The first line simply finds the slope between the two points $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$. The second does something with the point-slope form of a line using the point $(a, f(a))$. The tricky part is that last line defines an anonymous function to be returned (the <code>x -&gt;</code> part). So <code>secant</code> is an <em>operator</em> – a function which accepts a function for an argument and returns a function.</p><p>Using this function makes it simple to add a secant line to a graph. </p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = sin(x)
a, b = 0, pi/2
plot(f, a, b)
plot!(secant(f, a, b))</pre>
