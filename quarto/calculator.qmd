## Introduction


The programming language `Julia` (www.julialang.org) is a new language that builds on a long history of so-called dynamic scripting languages (DSLs).  DSLs are widely used for exploratory work and are part of the toolbox of most all data scientists, a rapidly growing area of employment. The basic `Julia` language is reminiscent of is `MATLAB`, though it offers many improvements over that language. For these notes, the focus will be on its more transparent syntax, but in general a major selling point of `Julia` is that it is much faster that `MATLAB` at many tasks.  (Well it should be, `MATLAB` was started back in the 70s.) Even better, `Julia` is an open-source project which means it is free to download and install, unlike the commercial package `MATLAB`.


These notes will use `Julia` to explore calculus concepts. Unlike some other programs used with calculus (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, and Sage) `Julia` is not a symbolic math language. Rather, we will use a numeric approach. This gives a different viewpoint on the calculus material supplementing that of the text book. Though there are a few idiosyncrasies we will see along the way, for the most part the `Julia` language will be both powerful and easy to learn.


In this project we start with baby steps – how to use `Julia` to perform operations we can do on the calculator. The use of a calculator requires knowledge about several things we take for granted here:


  * the use of the basic math operators
  * an understanding of the  order of operations, or knowing when parentheses are needed
  * how to use the buttons that compute functions such as the sine function
  * and how to use the memory feature to store intermediate computations.


Parallels of each of these will be discussed in the following.


## Expressions


`Julia` can replicate the basics of a calculator with the standard notations. The familiar binary operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^`.  With a calculator you "punch" in numbers and operators and to get an answer push the `=` key. Using `Julia` is not much different: you type in an expression then send to `Julia` to compute. The "equals key" on a calculator is replaced by the *enter* key on the keyboard (or *shift-enter* if using `IJulia`). Beyond that there isn't much difference.


For example, to add two and two we simply execute:


```{julia}
2 + 2
```

Or to convert $70$ degrees to Celsius with the standard formula $C=5/9(F-32)$:


```{julia}
(5/9)*(70 - 32)
```

Of to find a value of $32 - 16x^2$ when $x=1.5$:


```{julia}
32 - 16*(1.5)^2
```

To find the value of $\sqrt{15}$ we can use  power notation:


```{julia}
15^(1/2)
```

### Practice


#### Question


Compute $22/7$ in `Julia`.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
val = 22/7
numericq(val, 1e-5)
```

#### Question


Compute $\sqrt{220}$ in `Julia`.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
val = sqrt(220)
numericq(val, 1e-5)
```

#### Question


Compute $2^8$ in `Julia`.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
val = 2^8
numericq(val, 1e-5)
```

## Precedence


One drawback about using a calculator is the expression gets evaluated as it gets entered. For simple computations this is a convenience, but for more complicated ones it requires some thinking about the order of how an expression will be computed. In `Julia` you still need to be mindful of the order that operations are carried out, but as the entire expression is typed – and can be edited – before evaluation, you can more closely control what you want.


*Order of operations* refers to conventions used to decide which operation will happen first, when there is a choice of more than one. A simple example, is what is the value of $3 \cdot 2 + 1$?


There are two *binary* operations in this expressions: a multiplication and an addition. Which is done first and which second?


In some instances the order used doesn't matter. A case of this would be $3 + 2 + 1$. This is because addition is *associative*. (Well, not really on the computer, but that is another lesson.) In the case of $3 \cdot 2 + 1$ the order certainly matters.


For $3 \cdot 2 + 1$ if we did the addition first, the expression would be $9 = 3\cdot 3$. If we did the multiplication first, the value would be $7=6+1$. In this case, we all know that the correct answer is $7$, as we perform multiplication before addition, or in more precise terms the *precedence* of multiplication is higher than that of addition.


### Basics of PEMDAS


The standard order of the basic mathematical operations is remembered by many students through the mnemonic PEMDAS, which can be misleading, so we spell it out here:


  * (`P`) First parentheses
  * (`E`) then exponents (or powers)
  * (`MD`) then multiplication or division
  * (`AS`) then addition or subtraction.


This has the precedence of multiplication (part of `MD`) higher than that of subtraction (part of `AS`), as just mentioned.


Applying this, if we have the mathematical expression


$$
\frac{12 - 10}{2}
$$

We know that the subtraction needs to be done before the division, as this is how we interpret this form of division. How to make this happen? The precedence of parentheses is used to force the subtraction before the division, as in `(12-10)/2`. Without parentheses you get a different answer:


```{julia}
#| echo: false
(12 - 10)/2,  12 - 10/2
```

:::{.callout-note}
## Alert
Using a comma to separate expressions will cause both to print out – not just the last one evaluated. This trick is also a useful trick within an `IJulia` notebook.

:::

> Parentheses are used to force lower precedence operations to happen before higher precedence ones.



### Same precedence – what to do


There is a little more to the story, as we need to understand what happens when we have more then one operation with the same level. For instance, what is $2 - 3- 4$? Is it $(2 - 3) - 4$ or $2 - (3 - 4)$.


Unlike addition, subtraction is *not associative* so this really matters.  The subtraction operator is [left associative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_associativity) meaning the evaluation of $2 - 3 - 4$ is done by $(2-3) - 4$. The operations are performed in a left-to-right manner. Most – but not all operations – are left associative, some are right associative and performed in a right-to-left manner.


:::{.callout-note}
## Alert
**right to left** It is the order of which operation is done first, not reading from right to left, as one might read Arabic.

:::

To see that `Julia` has left associative subtraction, we can just check.


```{julia}
2 - 3 - 4, (2 - 3) - 4, 2 - (3 - 4)
```

Not all operations are processed left-to-right. The power operation, `^`, is *right associative*, as this matches the mathematical usage. For example:


```{julia}
4^3^2, (4^3)^2, 4^(3^2)
```

What about the case where we have different operations with the same precedence? What happens then? A simple example would be $2 / 3 * 4$? Is this done in a left to right manner as in:


```{julia}
(2 / 3) * 4
```

Or a right-to-left manner, as in:


```{julia}
2 / (3 * 4)
```

And the answer is *left-to-right*:


```{julia}
2 / 3 * 4
```

numericq(answer)
```

## Using functions


Most all calculators used are not limited to these basic arithmetic operations. So-called scientific calculators provide buttons for many of the common mathematical functions, such as exponential, logs, and trigonometric functions. `Julia` provides these too, of course.


There are special functions to perform common powers. For example, the square-root function is used as:


```{julia}
sqrt(15)
```

This shows how to evaluate a function – using its name and parentheses, as in `function_name(arguments)`. Parentheses are also used to group expressions, as would be done to do this using the power notation:


```{julia}
15^(1/2)
```

Additionally, parentheses are also used to make "tuples", a concept we don't pursue here but that is important for programming with `Julia`. The point here is the context of how parentheses are used is important, though for the most part the usage is the same as their dual use in your calculus text.


Like `sqrt`, there is also a cube-root function:


```{julia}
cbrt(27)
```

The `cbrt` and `sqrt` functions are not exactly the same as using `^`, as they differ when the inputs are not in their domain: For cube roots, we can see that there is a difference with negative bases:


```{julia}
cbrt(-8)			## correct
```

```{julia}
(-8)^(1/3)		        ## need first parentheses, why?
```

(The latter is an error as the power function has an output type that depends on the power being real, not a specific value of a real. For 1/2 the above would clearly be an error, so then for 1/3 `Julia` makes this an error.)


### trigonometric functions


The basic trigonometric functions in `Julia` work with radians:


```{julia}
sin(pi/4)
cos(pi/3)
```

But students think in degrees. What to do? Well, you can always convert via the ratio $\pi/180$:


```{julia}
sin(45 * pi/180)
cos(60 * pi/180)
```

However, `Julia` provides the student-friendly functions `sind`, `cosd`, and `tand` to work directly with degrees:


```{julia}
sind(45)
cosd(45)
```

Be careful, an expression like $\cos^2(\pi/4)$ is a shorthand for squaring the output of the cosine of $\pi/4$, hence is expressed with


```{julia}
cos(pi/4)^2			# not cos^2(pi/4) !!!
```

### Inverse trigonometric function


The math notation $\sin^{-1}(x)$ is also a source of confusion. This is **not** a power, rather it indicates an *inverse* function, in this case the arcsine. The arcsine function is written `asin` in `Julia`.


For certain values, the arcsine and sine function are inverses:


```{julia}
asin(sin(0.1))
```

However, this isn't true for all values of $x$, as $\sin(x)$ is not monotonic everywhere. In particular, the above won't work for $x$ values outside $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$:


```{julia}
asin(sin(100))
```

Other inverse trigonometric functions are `acos`, `atan` and for completeness `asec`, `acsc`, and `acot` are available for use.


### Exponential and logs


The values $e^x$ can be computed through the function `exp(x)`:


```{julia}
exp(2)
```

The constant value of `e` is only available on demand:


```{julia}
using Base.MathConstants
e
```

The logarithm function, `log` (and **not**  `ln`) does log base $e$:


```{julia}
log(exp(2))
```

To do base 10, there is a `log10` function:


```{julia}
log10(exp(2))
```

There is also a `log2` function for base 2. However, there are many more possible choices for a base. Rather than create functions for each possible one of interest the `log` function has an alternative form taking *two argument*. The first is interpreted as the base, the second the $x$ value. So the above, is also done through:


```{julia}
log(10, exp(2))
```

### Some useful functions


There are some other useful functions For example, `abs` for the absolute value, `round` for rounding, `floor` for rounding down and `ceil` for rounding up. Here are some examples


```{julia}
round(3.14)
```

```{julia}
floor(3.14)
```

```{julia}
ceil(3.14)
```

The observant eye will notice the answers above are not integers. (We discuss how to tell later.)  What to do if you want an integer? These functions take a "type" argument, as in `round(Int, 3.14)`.


### Practice

```{julia}
#| echo: false
numericq(sin(pi/10))
```

#### Question

```{julia}
#| echo: false
numericq(sind(52))
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false
numericq(sqrt(32-12))
```

#### Question


Which is greater $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
"`e^pi`",
"`pi^e`"
];
answer = e^pi - pi^e > 0 ? 1 : 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


What is the value of $\pi - (x - \sin(x)/\cos(x))$ when $x=3$?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
x = 3;
answer = x - sin(x)/cos(x);
numericq(pi - answer)
```

## Variables


With a calculator, one can store values into a *memory* for later usage. This useful feature with calculators is greatly enhanced with computer languages, where one can bind, or assign, a variable to a value. For example the command `x=2` will bind `x` to  the value $2$:


```{julia}
x = 2
```

So, when we evaluate


```{julia}
x^2
```

The value assigned to `x` is looked up and used to return $4$.


The word "dynamic" to describe the `Julia` language refers to the fact that variables can be reassigned and retyped. For example:


```{julia}
x = sqrt(2) ## a Float64 now
```

In `Julia` one can have single letter names, or much longer ones, such as


```{julia}
some_ridiculously_long_name = 3
```

```{julia}
some_ridiculously_long_name^2
```

The basic tradeoff being: longer names are usually more expressive and easier to remember, whereas short names are simpler to type. To get a list of the currently bound names, the `whos` function may be called. Not all names are syntactically valid, for example names can't begin with a number or include spaces.


:::{.callout-note}
## Alert
In fact, only *most* objects bound to a name can be arbitrarily redefined. When we discuss functions, we will see that redefining functions can be an issue and new names will need to be used. As such, it often works to stick to come convention for naming: numbers use values like `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`; functions like `f`, `g`, `h`, etc.

:::

To work with computer languages, it is important to appreciate that the equals sign in the variable assignment is unlike that of mathematics, where often it is used to indicate an equation which may be solved for a value. With the following computer command the right hand expression is evaluated and that value is assigned to the variable. So,


```{julia}
x = 2 + 3
```

does not assign the expression `2 + 3` to `x`, but rather the evaluation of that expression, which yields 5. (This also shows that the precedence of the assignment operator is *lower* than addition, as addition is performed first in the absence of parentheses.)


### Multiple assignments


At the prompt, a simple expression is entered and, when the *return* key is pressed, evaluated.  At times we may want to work with multiple subexpressions. A particular case might be setting different parameters:


```{julia}
a=0
b=1
```

Multiple expressions can be more tersely written by separating each expression using a semicolon:


```{julia}
a=0; b=1;
```

Note that `Julia` makes this task even easier, as one can do multiple assignments via "tuple destructuring:"


```{julia}
a, b  = 0, 1		## printed output is a "tuple"
a + b
```

### Practice


#### Question


Let $a=10$, $b=2.3$, and $c=8$. Find the value of $(a-b)/(a-c)$.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
a,b,c = 10, 2.3, 8;
numericq((a-b)/(a-c))
```

#### Question


What is the answer to this computation?


```
a = 3.2; b=2.3
a^b - b^a
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false
a = 3.2; b=2.3;
val = a^b - b^a;
numericq(val)
```

#### Question


For longer computations, it can be convenient to do them in parts, as this makes it easier to check for mistakes. (You likely do this with your calculator.)


For example, to compute


$$
\frac{p - q}{\sqrt{p(1-p)}}
$$

for $p=0.25$ and $q=0.2$ we might do:


```
p, q = 0.25, 0.2
top = p - q
bottom = sqrt(p*(1-p))
answer = top/bottom
```

What is the result of the above?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
p, q = 0.25, 0.2;
top = p - q;
bottom = sqrt(p*(1-p));
answer = top/bottom;
numericq(answer)
```

## Numbers


In mathematics, there a many different types of numbers. Familiar ones are integers, rational numbers, and the real numbers. In addition, complex numbers are needed to fully discuss polynomial functions. This is not the case with calculators.


Most calculators treat all numbers as floating point numbers – an approximation to the real numbers.  Not so with `Julia`.  `Julia` has types for many different numbers: `Integer`, `Real`, `Rational`, `Complex`, and specializations depending on the number of bits that are used, e.g., `Int64` and `Float64`. For the most part there is no need to think about the details, as values are promoted to a common type when used together. However, there are times where one needs to be aware of the distinctions.


### Integers and floating point numbers


In the real number system of mathematics, there are the familiar real numbers and integers. The integers are viewed as a subset of the real numbers.


Julia provides types `Integer` and `Real` to represent these values. (Actually, the `Integer` type represents more than one actual storage type, either `Int32` or `Int64`.) These are separate types. The type of an object is returned by `typeof()`.


For example, the integer $1$ is simply created by the value `1`:


```{julia}
1
```

The floating point value $1$ is specified by using a decimal point:


```{julia}
1.0
```

The two values are printed differently – integers never have a decimal point, floating point values always have a decimal point. This emphasizes the fact that the two values `1` and `1.0` are not the same – they are stored differently, they print differently, and can give different answers. In most cases – but not all – uses they can be used interchangeably.


For example, we can add the two:


```{julia}
1 + 1.0
```

This gives back the floating point value `2.0`. First the integer and floating point value are promoted to a common type (floating point in this case) and then added.


Sometimes there can be an issue. The value `2^(-3)` we know should be $1/2^3 = 1/8$ or `0.125` and `Julia` agrees:


```{julia}
2^(-3)
```

However, this is special cased. If `-3` is replaced with a variable name, there will be a failure:


```{julia}
x = -3
2^x
```

This gotcha has an explanation: in `Julia`, most functions are "type-stable" meaning, the type of the input (integer/integer in this case) should determine the type of the output (in this case floating point). But for this operation to be fast, `Julia` insists (in general) it be an integer, as what happens when the base is non-negative. It is not a "gotcha" when either the exponent or the base is a floating point number:


```{julia}
x = -3
2.0^x
```

When a computer is used to represent numeric values there are limitations: a computer only assigns a finite number of bits for a value. This works great in most cases, but since there are infinitely many numbers, not all possible numbers can be represented on the computer.


> The first limitation is numbers can not be arbitrarily large.



Take for instance a 64-bit integer.  A bit is just a place in computer memory to hold a $0$ or a $1$. Basically one bit is used to record the sign of the number and the remaining 63 to represent the numbers. This leaves the following range for such integers $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63} - 1$.


`Julia` is said to not provide training wheels. This means it doesn't put in checks for integer overflow, as these can slow things down. To see what happens, let just peek:


```{julia}
2^62				## about 4.6 * 10^18
2^63				## negative!!!
```

So if working with really large values, one must be mindful of the difference – or your bike might crash!


##### Gotchas


Look at the output of


```{julia}
2^3^4
```

Why is it 0? The value of $3^4=81$ is bigger than 63, so $2^{81}$ will overflow.


The following works though:


```{julia}
2.0 ^ 3 ^ 4
```

This is because the value `2.0` will use floating point arithmetic which has a much wider range of values. (The `Julia` documentation sends you to this interesting blog post [johndcook](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/04/06/anatomy-of-a-floating-point-number/), which indicates the largest floating point value is $2^{1023}(2 - 2^{-52})$ which is roughly `1.8e308`.


> Scientific notation is used to represent many numbers



A number in `Julia` may be represented in scientific notation. The basic canonical form is $a\cdot 10^b$, with $1 \leq |a| < 10$ and $b$ is an integer. This is written in `Julia` as `aeb` where `e` is used to separate the value from the exponent. The value `1.8e308` means $1.8 \cdot 10^{308}$. Scientific notation makes it very easy to focus on the gross size of a number, as the exponent is set off.


> The second limitation is numbers are often only an approximation.



This means expressions which are mathematically true, need not be true once approximated on the computer. For example,  $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number, that is, its decimal representation does not repeat the way a rational number does. Hence it is impossible to store on the computer an exact representation, at some level there is a truncation or round off. This will show up when you try something like:


```{julia}
2 - sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)
```

That difference of basically $10^{-16}$ is roughly the machine tolerance when representing a number. (One way to imagine this is mathematically, we have two ways to write the number $1$:


$$
0.\bar{9} = 0.9999... = 1
$$

but on the computer, you can't have the "..." in a decimal expansion – it must truncate – so instead values round to something like $0.9999999999999999$ or $1$, with nothing in between.


##### Comparing values


A typical expression in computer languages is to use `==` to compare the values on the left- and right-hand sides. This is not assignment, rather a question. For example:


```{julia}
2 == 2
2 == 3
sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) == 2		## surprising?
```

The last one would be surprising were you not paying attention to the last paragraph. Comparisons with `==` work well for integers and strings, but not with floating point numbers. (For these the `isapprox` function can be used.)


Comparisons do a promotion prior to comparing, so even though these numbers are of different types, the `==` operation treats them as equal:


```{julia}
1 == 1.0
```

The `===` operator has an even more precise notion of equality:


```{julia}
1 === 1.0
```

### Scientific notation


As mentioned, one can write `3e8` for  $3 \cdot 10^8$, but in fact to `Julia` the two values `3e8` and `3*10^8` are not quite the same, as one is stored in floating point, and one as an integer. One can use `3.0 * 10.0^8` to get a floating point equivalent to `3e8`.


> Floating point includes the special values: `NaN`, `Inf`. (Not so with integers.)



Floating point contains two special values: `NaN` and `Inf` to represent "not a number" and "infinity." These arise in some natural cases:


```{julia}
1/0				## infinity. Also -1/0.
```

```{julia}
0/0				## indeterminate
```

These values can come up in unexpected circumstances. For example division by $0$ can occur due to round off errors:


```{julia}
x = 1e-17
x^2/(1-cos(x))			## should be about 2

### Rational numbers


In addition to special classes for integer and floating point values, `Julia` has a special class for rational numbers, or ratios of integers. To distinguish between regular division and rational numbers, `Julia` has the `//` symbol to define rational numbers:


```{julia}
1//2
```

```{julia}
typeof(1//2)
```

As you know, a rational number $m/n$ can be reduced to lowest terms by factoring out common factors. `Julia` does this to store its rational numbers:


```{julia}
2//4
```

Rational numbers are used typically to avoid round off error when using floating point values. This is easy to do, as `Julia` will convert them when needed:


```{julia}
1//2 - 5//2                         ## still a rational
1//2 - sqrt(5)/2                    ## now a floating point
```

However, we can't do the following, as the numerator would be non-integer when trying to make the rational number:


```{julia}
(1 - sqrt(5)) // 2
```

### Complex numbers


Complex numbers are an extension of the real numbers when the values $i = \sqrt{-1}$ is added. Complex numbers have two terms: a real and imaginary part. They are typically written as $a + bi$, though the polar form $r\cdot e^{i\theta}$ is also used. The complex numbers have the usual arithmetic operations defined for them.


In `Julia` a complex number may be constructed by the `Complex` function:


```{julia}
z = Complex(1,2)
```

We see that `Julia` uses `im` (and not `i`) for the $i$. It can be more direct to just use this value in constructing complex numbers:


```{julia}
z = 1 + 2im
```

Here we see that the usual operations can be done:


```{julia}
z^2, 1/z, conj(z)
```

The value of $i$ comes from taking the square root of $-1$. This is almost true in `Julia`, but not quite. As the `sqrt` function will return a real value for any real input, directly trying `sqrt(-1.0)` will give a `DomainError`, as in $-1.0$ is not in the domain of the function. However, the `sqrt` function will return complex numbers for complex inputs. So we have:


```{julia}
sqrt(-1.0 + 0im)
```

Complex numbers have a big role to play in higher level mathematics. In calculus, they primarily occur as roots of polynomial equation.


### Practice


#### Question


Compute the value of $2^{1023}(2 -2^{-52})$ using `2.0` – not the integer `2`:


```{julia}
#| echo: false
answer = 2.0^1022 * 2 *(2.0 - 2.0^(-52));
choices = [
"`-Inf`",
"Domain Error",
"`1.7976931348623157e308`"
];
answer = 3;
radioq(choices, answer, hint="You must use 2.0 -- not 2 to do this.")
```

#### Question


The result of `sqrt(16)` is


```{julia}
#| echo: false

	"An integer",
	"A floating point number",
	"A rational number (fraction)"
	];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question

```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
	"An integer",
	"A floating point number",
	"A rational number (fraction)"
	];
answer = 1;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


The result of `1/2` is


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
	"An integer",
	"A floating point number",
	"A rational number (fraction)"
	];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


The result of `2/1` is


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
	"An integer",
	"A floating point number",
	"A rational number (fraction)"
	];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Which number is `1.23e4`?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
	"1234",
	"12340",
	"12300"
	];
answer = 3;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Which number is `-43e-2`?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
	"-0.43",
	"-4.30",
	"-43.0"
	];
answer = 1;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


What is the answer to the following:


```
val = round(3.4999999999999999);
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false
val = round(3.4999999999999999);
numericq(val; hint="This value is indistinguishable from 3.5")
```

#### Question

Recall that with 64-bit integers, we can only store numbers up to $2^{63} - 1$ without overflowing.
If you need more bits, `Julia` provides the `BigInt` class which allow for what is known as [*arbitrary precision arithmetic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic), where the number of bits used to store the number grows as needed.
Using this allows one to compute $2^{3^4}$ precisely as an integer:


```
x = BigInt(2)
answer = x^3^4
```

What is the answer?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
"`2417851639229258349412352`",
"`2.4178516392292583e24`",
"`0`"
];
answer = 1;
radioq(choices, answer)
```


:::{.callout-note}
## Alert
Like the `BigInt` class, `Julia` also has a `BigFloat` class for storing decimal numbers with arbitrary precision.
Due to some technical details of how floating point numbers are stored, the number of bits must be fixed in advance of any computation—unlike `BigInt`s whose precision can grow on-the-fly.
`Julia` provides the `setprecision` command to set this number of bits (e.g. `setprecision(1024)`). The default precision is $256$.
